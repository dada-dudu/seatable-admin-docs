# Two Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an extra layer of security used to make sure that people trying to gain access to the system are who they say they are. First, a user will enter their username and a password. Then, instead of immediately gaining access, they will be required to provide another piece of information. 

SeaTable requests as second factor a one-time passcode (OTP) that is typically generated by an mobile App on the cellphone of the user. 2FA works with all kind auf authentication types.

## Global configuration options

Admins are required to configure 2FA in the configuration file `dtable_web_settings.py`.

```bash
# Enable or disable two factor authentication globally in the SeaTable Server. Default is 'False'.
ENABLE_TWO_FACTOR_AUTH = True

# Option to enforce all users to use 2-factor-authentication. Default is 'False'.
# Changing 'True' to 'False' will deactivate 2FA for all users (they could still activate it
# in their personal settings).
ENABLE_FORCE_2FA_TO_ALL_USERS = True
```

## Team- and System admins

In addition to the general configuration options, a system administrator and a team administrator can use the web interface to force two-factor authentication for individual users and also deactivate it again. 

Team administrators can enforce two-factor authentication for their team in the team settings.
